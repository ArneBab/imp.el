Impatient Mode
==============

See the effect of your HTML as you type it.

This mode uses the simple-httpd webserver that runs within emacs to
serve up your HTML buffers as you edit them.

Set the buffer you want to live edit with:

M-x imp-set-current-buffer

And then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/imp-shim and
watch your changes appear as you type!
